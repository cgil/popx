Very low price point, but still too expensive for her. Her products are
cheap-ish and she would have to sell too many just to pay for the space.

Branding/story telling is important from a brands perspective. She said
it would be a good idea to get her brand out in front of people, maybe
for her its more of a marketing push.

She suggested I create templates that the vendors can choose from to
display their products. This way they have some control on
branding/display but its not too logistically difficult. She really
liked the idea of having an ipad in front of the display which she could
point to her online presence/website or other content.

She suggested the idea of having the business handle the marketing for
her as she does not have the bandwidth or expertise for that. She wants
to funnel people to her online channels.

My explanation took a while to register with her, she thought she would
have to be present in the shop to sell her goods. She also thought she
would have to be carrying the inventory to and from the shop everyday
which turned her off. Once I explained that she could ship her goods in
and not have to be present she was much more excited at the idea of
cheap/easy turnkey retail.

She doesn't have other friends in this space but was receptive and is OK
to keep chatting in the future as things progress.
