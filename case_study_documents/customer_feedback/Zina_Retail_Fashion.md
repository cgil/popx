Brands care about being on brand and how their products are showcased.

\$300/mo price point is too low! Closer to \$600/mo would still be ok
for emerging brands. Lowering process over time is a good strategy. I
should make it more expensive, she did not believe me that it would be
this cheap.

Location is important: Herald Sq. is most attractive location, SoHo is
good as well. Most important is foot traffic outside and how many people
I can attract to come inside the store. Products need to be curated and
have the same theme.

What would be really ideal is if I could get placement inside of already
established stores with established brands.

Need to make sure I'm clear that she does not need to be present and run
a both. I'm not being clear enough about what the service is. Once she
understood that it was a turnkey retail solution she was much more
interested.

She said a weekend popup cost a few thousand dollars.

May have two interested friends: designer purses \$800 each, and friend
who makes high end mens shirts.
