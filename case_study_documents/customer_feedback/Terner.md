She know Bulletin and the founder.

You don't make money from the storefront you take a cut from sales.
Similar to supermarkets, vendors pay variable rates for better spots.

If going into retail go stealth.

Check out Quiet logistics (ov, glossier), the true value is in software.

Bulletin targets clients with no physical retail presence, but software
is where the real money is.

Terner anecdotal:

-   She wouldn't want a storefront, there's no money there. Allie (bulletin co-founder) gets nervous around her business model, they lose money on each store.

-   B2b concept is where the money is

-   Wework is b2b not b2c

-   Supply chain strategy is where the money is

Allie was lead acapella crew in college, likely used her music
connections to get the super cheap retail space in Williamsburg.

Allie needed a visual merchandizer when she posted on page, she doesn't
have a great grasp in retail sometimes.

XRC (accelerator) is not recommended, Sunil left after two cohorts which
is troubling.
