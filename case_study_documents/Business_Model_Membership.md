Costco membership model + Warby Parker/Trunk club + audience curation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Inspiration & hypotheses: **

1)  Consumers have too many options. An overabundance of products and brands exhausts daily consumers who are forced to dig through dozens of choices to find the perfect fit. Consumers would be happier with limited and curated content by a trusted entity. As an example, consider Casper's success who piggybacks off this concept selling a single well crafted mattress.

2)  Given an overabundance in brands and with limited time, it's difficult to retain customer loyalty.

3)  People increasingly care about experiences.

4)  There are lot of products that people want to touch inventory before purchasing. ???

**The idea: **

-   There exists an online store and marketplace. Similar to Jet, you can only purchase within the marketplace through a monthly recurring membership (lock in). Members can purchase as expected online.

-   Your membership allows you rate products, low ranking products after some period of time are removed from the marketplace altogether. This is the curation step.

-   Similar to WarbyPaker or Trunk Club, there are items that customers are hesistant to purchase without physically touching it first.

    -   Shipping to individual customers with an expected high return rate is costly and something we need don't want to do, instead

    -   We have retail locations that act as showrooms spread throughout the city.

    -   Members can vote "hype up" products on the site. The most popular products for a given period (2weeks?) are sent to retail locations near the highest concentration of members who want to try the products.

    -   "Hyping up" an item, puts you into a funnel for that product, and you'll get periodic updates and reminders on where the products are as well as how long they'll be there. We'll attempt to get you into the store to purchase it.

-   As a part of your membership, we'll also send you a membership badge, or app, or something else, with a unique membership identifier.

-   To purchase within our store, you *must* be a member. You'll be able to sign up within the store.

-   Stores will carry no inventory besides the display pieces. There will be scattered interfaces within the store where you can scan your members badge that will automatically charge your stored credit card on our system. This will trigger normal shipping procedures from the backend to your house.

    -   Tap a button, purchased.

-   We want to serve the coolest and hottest things. A few options we have is to partner with independent makers on etsy, kickstarter, indigogo etc. For kickstarter, we can both allow presales, as well as let unfinished items be hyped up and later be distributed to the right locations and markets.

-   Each physical space has to be an **experience** every time you enter. It should not feel like a store but a friendly space to hang out and try different products or gadgets with friends. There may be events, fireside chats, vendors giving talks, etc. This is an exclusive members only club, not a normal retail store.

-   One tangential expansion is to either branch into different types of physical event spaces that can only be accessed by members or make partnerships with other retailers and vendors who sponsor members only products or events.

-   Potentially: The featured products in each store pay a monthly consignment fee to be in the space. But we take the brunt of the monetary risk. We charge:

    -   A base fee of (MONTHLY\_RENT / NUMBER\_OF\_VENDORS) but

        -   they don't pay upfront, instead we take 100% of profits from all sales until this fee is paid

    -   Then, we charge 5-10% on all additional sales.

The physical store should be treated as a showroom with a tradeshow
vibe. And should be pitched as such. Vendors shouldn't be expecting
sales within the store, but should be thought as a way to market in the
physical world. And customers are paying a membership fee to attend
these trade shows.
